Mean VC
A Screenplay by danunder
EXT. CRUSADER ARMY CAMP - AFTERNOON

Wise Wizard Professor HEADMASTER ALBUS DUMBLEDORE is arguing with bald Mutant Professor PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER. ALBUS tries to hug CHARLES but he shakes him off.

ALBUS
Please Charles, don't leave me.
CHARLES
I'm sorry Albus, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
ALBUS
I am such a person!
CHARLES frowns.

CHARLES
I'm sorry, Albus. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
CHARLES leaves.

ALBUS sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, bald Master of the four elements AVATAR AANG OF THE AIR NOMADS barges in looking flustered.

ALBUS
Goodness, Aang! Is everything okay?
AANG
I'm afraid not.
ALBUS
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
AANG
It's ... an VC ... I saw an evil VC reprogram a bunch of toasters!
ALBUS
Defenseless toasters?
AANG
Yes, defenseless toasters!
ALBUS
Bloomin' heck, Aang! We've got to do something.
AANG
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
ALBUS
You can start by telling me where this happened.
AANG
I was...
AANG fans himself and begins to wheeze.

ALBUS
Focus Aang, focus! Where did it happen?
AANG
Bank vault! That's right - Bank vault!
ALBUS springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

ALBUS rushes along the street, followed by AANG. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


INT. BANK VAULT - SHORTLY AFTER

SMITH SMITH a mean VC terrorises two toasters.

ALBUS, closely followed by AANG, rushes towards SMITH, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

AANG
What is is? What's the matter?
ALBUS
That's not just any old VC, that's Smith Smith!
AANG
Who's Smith Smith?
ALBUS
Who's Smith Smith? Who's Smith Smith? Only the most mean VC in the universe!
AANG
Blinkin' knickers, Albus! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most mean VC in the universe!
ALBUS
You can say that again.
AANG
Blinkin' knickers, Albus! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most mean VC in the universe!
ALBUS
I'm going to need hacks, lots of hacks.
Smith turns and sees Albus and Aang. He grins an evil grin.

SMITH
Albus Dumbledore, we meet again.
AANG
You've met?
ALBUS
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young ALBUS is sitting in a park listening to some dubstep music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees SMITH. He takes off his headphones.

SMITH
Would you like some turkish delight?
ALBUS's eyes light up, but then he studies SMITH more closely, and looks uneasy.

ALBUS
I don't know, you look kind of mean.
SMITH
Me? No. I'm not mean. I'm the least mean VC in the world.
ALBUS
Wait, you're a VC?
ALBUS runs away, screaming.


INT. BANK VAULT - PRESENT DAY

SMITH
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
AANG
(To ALBUS) You ran away?
ALBUS
(To AANG) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
ALBUS turns to SMITH.

ALBUS
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
ALBUS runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

ALBUS
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with hacks.
SMITH
I'm not scared of you.
ALBUS
You should be.

EXT. FAIRGROUND - LATER THAT DAY

ALBUS and AANG walk around searching for something.

ALBUS
I feel sure I left my hacks somewhere around here.
AANG
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly hacks.
ALBUS
You know nothing Aang of the Air Nomads.
AANG
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, SMITH appears, holding a pair of hacks.

SMITH
Looking for something?
AANG
Crikey, Albus, he's got your hacks.
ALBUS
Tell me something I don't already know!
AANG
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
ALBUS
I know that already!
AANG
I don't know how to ride a bike.
SMITH
(appalled) Dude!
While SMITH is looking at AANG with disgust, ALBUS lunges forward and grabs his deadly hacks. He wields them, triumphantly.

ALBUS
Prepare to die, you mean radish!
SMITH
No please! All I did was reprogram a bunch of toasters!
CHARLES enters, unseen by any of the others.

ALBUS
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those toasters were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Albus Dumbledore defender of innocent toasters.
SMITH
Don't hurt me! Please!
ALBUS
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these hacks on you right away!
SMITH
Because Albus, I am your father.
ALBUS looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

ALBUS
No you're not!
SMITH
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
SMITH tries to grab the hacks but ALBUS dodges out of the way.

ALBUS
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, SMITH slumps to the ground.

AANG
Did he just faint?
ALBUS
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly hacks.
ALBUS crouches over SMITH's body.

AANG
Be careful, Albus. It could be a trick.
ALBUS
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Smith Smith is dead!
ALBUS
What?
ALBUS
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
AANG claps his hands.

AANG
So your hacks did save the day, after all.
CHARLES steps forward.

CHARLES
Is it true? Did you kill the mean VC?
ALBUS
Charles how long have you been...?
CHARLES puts his arm around ALBUS.

CHARLES
Long enough.
ALBUS
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Smith Smith.
CHARLES
Then the toasters are safe?
ALBUS
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable toasters enter, looking relived.

CHARLES
You are their hero.
The toasters bow to ALBUS.

ALBUS
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Smith Smith will never reprogram toasters ever again, is enough for me.
CHARLES
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the toasters passes ALBUS a raddest beyblade

CHARLES
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
ALBUS
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

ALBUS
Well, if you insist.
ALBUS takes the beyblade.

ALBUS
Thank you.
The toasters bow their heads once more, and leave.

ALBUS turns to CHARLES.

ALBUS
Does this mean you want me back?
CHARLES
Oh, Albus, of course I want you back!
ALBUS smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

ALBUS
Well you can't have me.
CHARLES
WHAT?
ALBUS
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a VC to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
CHARLES
But...
ALBUS
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Aang.
AANG grins.

CHARLES
But...
AANG
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
CHARLES
Albus?
ALBUS
I'm sorry Charles, but I think you should skidaddle.
CHARLES leaves.

AANG turns to ALBUS.

AANG
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
ALBUS
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly AANG stops.

AANG
When I said I don't know how to ride a bike, you know I was just trying to distract the VC don't you?
THE END
